Sooo. The SnarkPit then. The 'ancestor' of this site first started out being hosted on AOL- 5 pages of awesome editing
knowledge (created with AOLPress, one of the most powerful website tools ever- more so than Geocities Pagebuilder). 
Back then, it was just "Leperous' Worldcraft Website" and had a fantastic top banner which, sadly, has been lost.</p>
<p align=center><?php echo screenshot('','','index/about_1.jpg'); ?><img src="index/about_1_thumb.jpg" border=0></a></p>

Anyhoo, the website moved around a bit, and became gameditors.co.uk for a while (I had a plan to create an editing empire,
like most normal people should do. I was young.). And lo, the website became fully editing orientated and FrontPage built:
</p>
<p align=center><?php echo screenshot('','','index/about_2.jpg'); ?><img src="index/about_2_thumb.jpg" border=0></a></p>

We then started doing reviews after a short while- first website I knew about that combined editing with reviewed examples
of what to (not) do- and moved to another host when the bandwidth use got a bit much. Then, cunningly, we decided to track
down every OP4 map ever made and offer them up for download, and got kicked off our new host (sprite-network) for, er, bandwidth. But
hooray for PlanetHalflife for hosting us back in August 2000 (it used to be a great website, before the Lamespy rot kicked in),
we could host all the maps we ever dreamed of on Fileplanet- back in those days, you didn't have to queue to download maps. 
</p>
<p align=center><?php echo screenshot('','','index/about_3.jpg'); ?><img src="index/about_3_thumb.jpg" border=0></a></p>

That was the 'golden age'of reviewing, with a spinkee new PHP review database being built (über kudos to ScaryJeff, this site wouldn't be here today
without his help) and a not-so-spinkee ezBoard forum. ezBoard forum was (still is!) rubbish, moved to ForumPlanet which was
even worse as ASP is the tool of the devil, and then ended up with phpBB, the framework of which eventually helped create 
this new site when I decided that I'd had enough of popup ads.

<p>So, the PHPtastic site you see below was rolled out in February
2002 at <b>www.snarkpit.com</b> after months of work, hosted by <a href="http://www.edgenetwork.org/" target="_blank"><b>EdgeNetwork</b></a>.
A "mapfinger" ability to add maps to your profile was introduced here, along with your own ".plan" (as they were known
back in the day).
</p>

<?php echo screenshot('','','index/about_4.jpg'); ?><img src="index/about_4_thumb.jpg" border=0></a>
</p>

<p>They got a bit silly with map downloads, and for various unrememberable reasons we moved to a new host
<b><a href="http://www.oktagone.net.au" target="_blank">Oktagone</a></b> sometime in 2003, and despite the 90% downtime
stuck with them for a while yet.
Along the way, I managed to pick up a few drifters who I managed to beat into becoming 'staff'- Mikee, Versager, some
guy with 'Dragon' in his name who was hell-bent on collecting all the OP4 maps ever created, and of course Gwil who still
to this day just loafs around doing nothing except complaining about the Wicked Ways of the Western World.
</p>
<p align=center><?php echo screenshot('','','index/about_5.jpg'); ?><img src="index/about_5_thumb.jpg" border=0></a></p>

<p>However, at the beginning of 2005, our hosts Oktagone went through a number of problems. First, they claimed that a
power outage had cut off everyone's website for the time being, when in fact the real reason was because they hadn't paid
their server bills. It took 2 weeks of pestering the quite clearly incapable boss in an IRC room to get the website back
up at the beginning of March, in their new datacenter that they'd built (on a free hosting plan!).
But then mid-March, they claimed that a DDoS attack on their network had effectively bankrupted them (again, probably a
lie, but who knows- at least they weren't too busy to make themselves a brand new website in the mean time)
and the site went down for another 2 weeks. E-mails asking for the domain name back went ignored, and finally when my
requests started to be bounced, we moved domain to <b>snarkpit.net</b>, and are currently hosted by <a href="http://www.globat.com" target="_blank">Globat</a>
who, despite their many (oft hidden) faults, are still pretty damn cheap.

<p>And what for the future? If I were a futurist I'd certainly hire Monqui, as I like the cut of his jib. And remind
him that we have crushed all who oppose us in the past!
