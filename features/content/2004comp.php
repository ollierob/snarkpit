<?php tracker('2004 Mapping Competition Details','features.php?page=articles&id=85'); ?>

We've been discussing this in the forums, and a lot of people seemed to want a 'themed' contest, and a lot seemed to want 'flat-shaded' maps. Some peons even wanted texture limitation, and I personally wanted to have 'incorrect dimensions'.
So, seeing as we're a democracy ruled by a dictator, we're going to have a themed competition, but what the theme is is up to you. Flat shaded, texture limitation, concept art again, too big/too small, whatever- make a map with some kind of twist to it. It's the last HL competition we're ever going to have, so go for it and make your last ever HL map! The only limitation is it should be a playable Half-Life Deathmatch map (i.e. have weapons and player starts, and not have stupidly high r_speeds). You can "retheme" existing, released maps if you want, but we will be biased against them unless there's a fairly radical change (this rule doesn't apply to existing but unreleased maps).

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">You can't really guess the twist here- apparently, it's a mixture of a roman theme with texture limitation. Which could have been interesting, but sadly the result just looks like someone's 2nd map. It's a fairly small and empty white house/villa thingy, surrounded by a garden, and I can only guess the players in this map are meant to be mole stranglers or snake whackers.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">What's black and white and red all over? This map with a bit of fragging going on. Ho ho. An 'accident' has caused all the colour to drain out of the Black Mesa facility, leaving you to fight in monochrome around a fractured warehouse and labs. Despite the cheeky connectivity (teleporters linking together darkened corridors), it's a nicely realised level, although perhaps it shoots itself in the foot by being a bit boring.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">The first release from this author is more of a showcase for their excellent tree models than anything else! It's a very large, fairly dark and quite well detailed level, with a Mediterranean setting, though the TFC textures have been used a million times elsewhere and might feel dated. It's a decent enough map that is laid out well and has the capacity for a lot of players (though weapons and items are pretty thin on the ground) but there isn't really anything special about it.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">Now this is a theme- a fairytale land come to life, with you fighting around a gingerbread house and some kind of crazy Alice-in-Wonderland-style setting, though it's perhaps not as distubing. Although it's quite obviously unfinished- clipping problems, 'lazy' teleporters and dodgy upwards waterfalls to name a few glitches- it still does play well. Set around a cave, a couple of outdoor areas and a strange crooked house's interior, the set pieces here are very well made and should impress everyone who has a look.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">Although, yes, this map is a killbox, it's not quite the disgrace to all that humanity has achieved over the centuries that you may expect. Flat shaded textures coat a tall room with various teleporters, floating platforms and fairly decent architecture- no weird ramps and the usual piles of weapons (though not quite the same concentration of gauss/rockets that is characteristic). I guess the twist here is that it's not eye-burningly, brain-numbingly bad! Seriously though, if it's really meant to be flat-shaded then the lighting has messed that up, otherwise I can't tell what it's meant to be, unless it's the central teleporter which takes you up to the ceiling of the room. Would have been nice to see what the author could have come up with if they had more than 3 days to make this, though.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">If this level wasn't totally unsuited to run in Half-Life's engine, it would make a damn fine level (HL2 perhaps?). Great theme, but way too ambitious for this old game. A perfectly "flat-shaded" level, it's the 3D realisation of what you'd get if you gave a small child some luminous felt tip pens and told them to draw a pirate island. You can run all the way around, and are spawned with a gauss and full armour etc. and have fun around the towers and central volcano. It is technically playable but not unless you have a really good computer- this one even slowed down my 'old' Pentium 4. So possibly the best theme, but sadly the least playable out of them all.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">Inspired by, surprisingly, the Magical World of Harry Potter, this is an attempt that didn't come out too well, though you can tell the author did try their best. We have an outdoors hut, what seems to be a courtroom, a commonroom (complete with custom 'spell' sound-effect when you open the door, and, er, what seem to be magical sofas...) and a few chambers and corridors. Being unfortunate enough to have seen a couple of the films and played the (terrible) games, I didn't really see any sets or props here that would make me think 'Harry Potter', or even 'magical', except for a stab at the staircase and a few floating candles. A few visual and clipping errors, among other things, gives you the feeling that this level is unfinished too- hopefully the HL2 version will be more focused and polished.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">This is a visually stunning level set around Melee Island from the Monkey Island games (which you should go play <b>now</b>, if you never have). Plenty of nooks and crannies to hide in, familiar places to visit and courtyards to run around, along with some nice set pieces and very little blocky architecture. It can get a bit cramped at times, and in the review version there were several missing textures, but otherwise with decent weapon placement and slightly strange layout it makes a good DM level too- just remember to whip out the Guybrush player models.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">I never thought I'd say this, but here we have a killbox with class. You all start in a room with no weaponry (feels like playing Quasar/Laser Quest) and have to proceed through teleporters into the 'Omni Arena', which is a big, low-gravity room whose shape and weapon content changes with time (gauss cannons becoming available after a few minutes). The best killbox ever made- one I can probably stand without literally exploding- and actually quite nifty in places, such as the Martian setting and teleporters/grav-tubes.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">"Escher-esque" is a phrase that's been bandied about describing this map- don't judge it from the screenshots, but play it. Various staircases linking floating, ruined platforms, overhanging a dark abyss and with rocks/blocks flying around the outside- combine with the ambient sound, and the way the level is so open and leaves you vulnerable to attack from anywhere, this is something you probably won't forget playing. R_speeds can be a problem here if you have a slower PC, and as always with this kind of map falling off the edge can get annoying, especially when trying to use the dodgy bounce pads. Very clever, and very well done.

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">This sprawling behemoth of a map was inspired by the recent Prince of Persia game. So far, it looks incredible- amazing textures, nice lighting and windows, huge outdoor areas and excellent interior architecture which can keep you exploring for ages; and plays pretty well too- plenty of vertical combat, a cool trap involving gates and enough weaponry for the number of players that you need. I say 'so far' as it's obviously still in beta stages and needs a lot of work, but what there is is very impressive indeed. Extra points for the "Hall of Fame/Shame"!

<tr><td colspan=2 valign=top><blockquote class="abouttext">Another black/white/grey level with no shadows whatsoever, this one sits neatly in the Datacore-category-draw. Your typical semi-symmetrical, shotgun-blasting corridor level, this is one you'll remember. Though it has a confusing layout to being with, you'll quickly get the hang of it, especially if you overcome the rather disconcerting looking teleporters. Funky design, with loads of strange machinery and rooms, it's both very playable and has a well applied, strong theme.

<p><font size=4 color="#cc6600">Verdict:</font></p>
<p>First I'd like to thank everyone who entered this competition- the general quality of maps was really superb. But enough idle speil!
<p>Atrium, Fishy, Hogwarts and Thanto unfortunately didn't have much of a theme going for them. 
Abstract Towers, Black, Omni-Arena, Skull Cave and Flat Killbox all had great themes, but lacked in the playability or design departments a bit.
And Superman was just disturbing. 
<p>Fairtytale and Persian Letters had excellent, well developed themes and the potentials to become awesome maps, but to me they both felt too unfinished and had various problems- I think a finished version of either would have won. And of course there's the problem of Flatshaded making me want/need to buy a new computer.
<p>Which leaves us with Pulse, Parralaxion, Reclamation, ZGZ, Melee 3D and Sorrow - I don't think any of our past competitions
has such a lineup of great maps to choose a winner from! Out of those, Pulse, Parralaxion and Melee 3D were my favourites, but I'll have to
name <b>Pulse</b> as my winner. It's just such a unique, well-crafted and fun map, and is one that I've wanted to play since first seeing screenshots of it. So congratulations Mr Hawkins, a copy of Half-Life 2 will make its way <i>somehow</i> through the power of Steam to you; entering twice really does pay off!
