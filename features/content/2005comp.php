It's time for our yearly mapping competition, and it's our first for the Source engine! So fire up your copy of
Steam and make sure those displacement-surface and smoothing group skills are up to scratch.

<p><img src="features/content/2005-dali.jpg" align="right"><b>Aim:</b> Simply make something "unreal": a place or situation that you simply wouldn't ever find
yourself fighting over if World War 3 were ever to come around.
Think "surreal" or "abstract" or "mind-bending" though, rather than just "futuristic" or "unlikely."
Something out of the depths of your warped mind or dreams, or inspired by a work of art, or perhaps just how you picture
a particularly strange or grand scene in a fantasy/sci-fi book.
We're <b>NOT</b> looking for more Combine bases or warehouses or embattled towns, or killboxes with purple lights,
or anything else resembling anything in Half-Life 2 <i>or in real life</i> (past, present or possible future, 
unless heavily distorted).
</p>

<p><b>Ideas:</b> The map doesn't necessarily have to be surreal: if you don't feel like a map-making god or don't have
access to loads of custom textures, try creating a miniature (or <a href="maps.php?map=19">macroture</a>) Rats! style
level (though try to base them around/inside objects, rather than rooms in your house!).
You could try making a fantasy setting (e.g. <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=dm%20avalon">DM Avalon</a>)
or a crazy space setting (e.g. <a href="maps.php?map=1628">DM Tribute</a>) or a dream-world setting (e.g. Max Payne dream
sequences). Just make something crazy that isn't very realistic, but yet is still a playable deathmatch level;
if you're unsure, ask in our <a href="forums.php?forum=1">forums</a>.
The size of the map doesn't matter, but you should aim to make it be fun for 8+ players.
</p>

<p><b>Judging:</b> Graphical and gameplay aspects of the map will be judged, along with how original and exciting
the theme is.
As ever, there will also be a 'popular' vote where the peons of this website pick their favourite.</p>

<p><b>Prizes:</b> Prizes are yet to be announced, but at the very least there will a new console/PC game for the winner.
The best maps will also go onto permanent rotation on our HL2DM server.</p>

<p><b>Deadline:</b> All submissions must be in by 23:59 GMT on Sunday 14th August 2005. You've got plenty of time, so
the deadline is strict.</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>You can base your level off concept art or sculptures if you wish, but reproductions of film scenes or other
peoples maps or other games aren't allowed.
<li>Custom textures, models, skyboxes etc. are allowed.
<li>You are allowed to enter up to 2 levels.
<li>Maps must be playable HL2 deathmatch levels, and be fully compiled with no (obvious) errors.
<li>Maps must be be submitted in a .ZIP or .RAR file with a readme, and should be listed in your
<a href="users.php?name=<?=$userdata['username']?>">profile</a> by the deadline.
<li>The editor's decision (i.e. Leperous') is final.
</ul>
