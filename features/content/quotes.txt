<li><b>Mephs</b> summing things up for us
<div class="abouttext">Making conversation in #snarkpit is like making conversation at a bus stop. If you stick around for
a while people HAVE to talk eventually. Even if it is a scabby vagrant asking for change and cigarettes, or an elderly
person asking stupidly obvious questions about when the bus comes when it clearly says so on the bus timetable....Its set
to be a cold winter this year. It should thin out the numbers of both types of bus stop scum with any luck.</div>
